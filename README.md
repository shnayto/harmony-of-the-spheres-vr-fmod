# harmony-of-the-spheres-vr-fmod
Harmony of the Spheres aims to revisit the magic of the once-revered concept of celestial harmony in a standalone application for the Meta Quest 2. Within a virtual solar system, listeners can interact with celestial bodies to explore musical relationships between them, recontextualising this ancient theory within virtual reality.
